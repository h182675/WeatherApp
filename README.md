# Weather App

Simple web-app fetching API data from weather
service. Uses express on node.js.

---
##### Setup:
- Requires Node.js.
- Uses NPM
- ```npm install``` to install the required packages.

---
##### Learning outcomes:

- Setting up a basic Express Server.
- Using ejs to send data from backend to view.

##### Thoughts going forward:

- Use a front-end framework like Vue/React.
- Getting quite confident with extracting API data. But may be more interesting storing it in a SQL database.
- In addition to using a DB storing fetches to avoid spamming the API. Not out of necessity, but interest.
